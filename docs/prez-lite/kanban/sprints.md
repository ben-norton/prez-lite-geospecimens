## ✅ Completed Sprint: Sprint 14 - Edit Dialog Polish

**Duration:** 2026-02-17
**Goal:** Fix dialog/popup UX issues in edit mode
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (4/4 completed)

**Completed:**
- ✅ Show language changes clearly in edit diff — `formatObjectValue()` appends `@lang` to literals in diffs
- ✅ Fix history dropdown height shift on hover — opacity toggling instead of display toggling
- ✅ Add titles to diff and save changes dialogs — proper `#header` slots on three UModals
- ✅ Make diff and save dialogs draggable — `useDraggableModal` composable with CSS `translate`

**Velocity:** 4 tasks completed

---

## ✅ Completed Sprint: Sprint 13 - Edit Mode Polish

**Duration:** 2026-02-16 to 2026-02-17
**Goal:** Clear quick-win editing bugs and fill the core label/IRI editing gap
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (3/3 completed, 1 deferred)

**Completed:**
- ✅ Fix empty property display in edit mode — removed "---" dash from editable empty properties in ConceptForm and InlineEditTable
- ✅ Add loading state to sign-in flow — inline head script hides pre-rendered HTML during OAuth callback; Vue shows spinner until redirect completes
- ✅ Add new concept creation in edit mode — "Add" button creates concepts with proper triples; tree auto-expands to reveal new node and scrolls into view; page refresh also expands to URL concept

**Deferred:**
- Enable editing of concept label and IRI — moved back to backlog (IRI editing scoped to new items only)

**Velocity:** 3 tasks completed

   - URL-driven state: `edit`, `sha`, `concept` params with `router.push` for back/forward
   - Extracted `buildChangeSummary()` to `ttl-patch.ts` for reuse between save modal and history diffs
   - History labels resolved from N3 store (prefLabels, filtered structural predicates)
   - Waits for auth token + vocab slug before fetching (handles page refresh)

### Sprint Velocity
- **Planned:** 2 tasks
- **Completed:** 2 tasks
